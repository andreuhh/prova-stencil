      text-article=" Global warming and climate change pose an existential threat to the
    low-lying nations of the Pacific. Sea level rise, coastal erosion,
    and super typhoons are already proving scientists’ predictions that
    they may disappear beneath the waves within decades."

      text-article-2="Yet the plain of Castelluccio is magnificent even in winter, and in this season the snow is plentiful
     and offers views of great charm, an impressive peace and silence falling over the hills.
      During this bleak season the country is almost deserted, 
      and there are perhaps only four or five families resisting the complete
       isolation that is so often created when the roads become impassable and blocked by deep snow."

      text-article-3="The event was founded by Alessandro
     d‘Emilia and Armin Holzer, two highliners who wanted to share the spectacular scenery of 
     Monte Piana (Misurina) in the Dolomites, giving professionals and enthusiasts from all 
     over the world the chance to slackline between mountain peaks,
     hang out in hammocks strung high in the sky, and meet like-minded people."
